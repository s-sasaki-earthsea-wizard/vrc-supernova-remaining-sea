1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:10,640
It might be hard to believe, but traces of supernova explosions that occurred millions of years ago are imprinted in Earth's deep ocean floor.

2
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:19,960
It's hard to believe at first that evidence of stellar explosions in space has been left at the bottom of the ocean.

3
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:29,019
The key to solving this mystery is a special and extremely rare substance called iron-60.

4
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,260
Today, let's explore how this special iron,

5
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,600
which differs from ordinary iron,

6
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,000
tells us the grand history of the universe.

7
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,160
First, let me explain about our main character, iron-60.

8
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,040
The iron you're familiar with is iron-56.

9
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:57,959
It has 26 protons and 30 neutrons in its nucleus.

10
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:06,040
But iron-60, which we're discussing today, is a special type of iron with as many as 34 neutrons.

11
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:18,560
Iron-60 is actually radioactive and slowly transforms into another element over an incredibly long period of 2.6 million years.

12
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:27,940
2.6 million years is roughly the same time from when our stone-tool-using ancestors appeared to the present day.

13
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,080
That's how long it is.

14
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,100
But here's an important point.

15
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,760
Iron-60 is not naturally produced on Earth.

16
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,580
So where did it come from?

17
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,260
The answer lies in space.

18
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,460
In massive stars that are 8 to 25 times heavier than our Sun.

19
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:57,200
Their cores are worlds of unimaginably high temperature and pressure.

20
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:05,400
Temperatures reach billions of degrees, and pressure is hundreds of billions of times Earth's atmospheric pressure.

21
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:17,640
In this extreme environment, which is extremely rich in neutrons compared to normal conditions, iron-58 captures neutrons to create iron-60.

22
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,660
It's like cosmic alchemy.

23
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:30,480
And when a star reaches the end of its life, it creates one of the universe's most powerful explosions - a supernova.

24
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:39,060
Its power is so great that it releases in just a few seconds the energy the Sun would emit over 10 billion years.

25
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,860
This explosion scatters iron-60 throughout space.

26
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:58,780
From the 1960s to 1970s, the American research vessel Eltanin collected sediments - basically sand and rock fragments -

27
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,440
from ocean floors around the world.

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,280
This survey also provided important evidence for proving the theory of continental drift.

29
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:13,560
But there was an astonishing discovery.

30
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:26,640
Iron-60, which shouldn't exist on Earth, was found in deep ocean floors across the Indian Ocean, Pacific Ocean, and Atlantic Ocean - all over the world.

31
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:31,780
Iron-60 that shouldn't be naturally produced on Earth.

32
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,120
When and where did it come from?

33
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:43,540
When scientists examined the iron-60 in rock fragments collected from the ocean floor by Eltanin,

34
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:49,280
interestingly, there were clear peaks in the amount of iron-60.

35
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:54,540
About 1.7 to 3.2 million years ago,

36
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,820
and about 6.5 to 8.7 million years ago - two distinct periods.

37
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:05,840
Apparently something special happened during these times.

38
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:13,520
Scientists believe this is evidence of supernova explosions that occurred near Earth.

39
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,880
But "near" is relative on a cosmic scale.

40
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:24,500
The estimated distance is about 230 to 330 light-years away.

41
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:28,660
A distance that would take over 200 years even at the speed of light.

42
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,020
The iron-60 released by the supernova explosion

43
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,400
traveled through space for a long time,

44
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,720
eventually entering Earth's atmosphere,

45
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,160
then raining down into the ocean,

46
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,300
and slowly accumulating on the ocean floor.

47
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:51,080
The fact that iron-60 continued to fall for 1.5 million years

48
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,800
suggests not a single explosion,

49
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:59,320
but likely multiple supernova explosions occurring in succession.

50
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,720
Actually, our solar system is currently

51
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,420
in what's called the Local Bubble,

52
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:09,380
a region of space particularly sparse in matter,

53
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,200
like being inside a bubble.

54
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,180
Its radius is about 500 light-years,

55
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,120
and it continues to expand at about 6.5 km per second even now.

56
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,920
To explain this simply,

57
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,260
it's like blowing sand with a fan.

58
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,960
The wind blows the sand away, leaving the center sparse,

59
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,700
while creating walls of sand around it.

60
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:42,140
Scientists believe this Local Bubble was created by

61
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:46,200
multiple supernova explosions over the past 14 million years.

62
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:52,860
And the iron-60 in the deep ocean is an important clue to its formation process.

63
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,160
But I'm sure many of you are wondering:

64
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:03,000
How did they measure a substance with a half-life of 2.6 million years?

65
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,280
Usually, the half-life of radioactive materials is measured by observing their decay.

66
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,300
But 2.6 million years is longer than human history.

67
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,380
Observation would be impossible, right?

68
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:21,280
So scientists came up with a clever method.

69
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:28,200
They artificially created iron-60 by bombarding copper with protons in a nuclear reaction,

70
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:34,980
then compared that iron-60 with iron-55, which has a half-life of 2.7 years.

71
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:40,540
Some of you may know about carbon-14 dating.

72
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:45,740
That famous method used in archaeology to determine ages.

73
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:52,440
Carbon-14 dating uses not only the radioactive isotope carbon-14,

74
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,140
but also its ratio to the stable isotope carbon-12.

75
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:01,820
Rather than just measuring the absolute amount of carbon-14,

76
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:06,160
by comparing it with carbon-12, we can eliminate the effects

77
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:12,500
of increased atmospheric carbon from external factors like fossil fuels and nuclear testing.

78
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,280
Using a similar principle, by comparing with a substance of known half-life,

79
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,780
we can accurately measure even long half-lives.

80
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,120
When we think of space research,

81
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:32,140
most people imagine observing the universe with telescopes.

82
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:38,860
But the fact that treasures for unraveling cosmic mysteries

83
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,620
were sleeping deep in the ocean floor as radioactive isotopes

84
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:47,100
is unexpectedly fascinating, don't you think?

85
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:55,860
Radioactive isotopes can act as clocks for recording the history of the universe and humanity.

86
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:11,940
The connection between space, the ocean, and radiation, and how they became keys to solving cosmic mysteries - it's a wonderful example of how collaboration between different fields of knowledge leads to new discoveries.
